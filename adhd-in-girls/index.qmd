## Specialized ADHD Assessment for Girls and Young Women

At BrainWorkup Neuropsychology, we specialize in the assessment and diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in girls and young women. This critical area has been historically underrepresented in research and clinical practice, leading to significant underdiagnosis in female populations.

Girls often display ADHD symptoms differently than boys, which is why we provide specialized evaluations designed to identify ADHD as it uniquely presents in female patients. Our comprehensive approach ensures we capture the full picture of each individual's cognitive profile, strengths, and challenges.

## Why Girls with ADHD Are Often Missed

Girls with ADHD frequently go undiagnosed because:

- They tend to show fewer hyperactive and impulsive behaviors than boys
- They're more likely to have the inattentive presentation of ADHD
- They often develop coping strategies that mask their symptoms
- They may present with anxiety or depression that overshadows ADHD symptoms
- Traditional ADHD criteria were developed based primarily on male presentations

## Common Signs of ADHD in Girls

ADHD can manifest differently in girls and young women. Common signs include:

### Inattention Signs
- Difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or activities
- Appearing to not listen when spoken to directly
- Struggling with organization and time management
- Frequently losing items necessary for tasks
- Being easily distracted by external stimuli or thoughts

### Social and Emotional Signs
- Excessive talking or interrupting in conversations
- Difficulty maintaining friendships
- Heightened emotional sensitivity
- Low self-esteem or negative self-perception
- Anxiety or mood fluctuations

### Academic Signs
- Inconsistent academic performance
- Procrastination and difficulty completing assignments
- Careless mistakes in schoolwork
- Trouble with sustained mental effort
- Difficulty transitioning between activities

## Our Assessment Approach

Our comprehensive ADHD evaluations for girls include:

1. **Detailed Clinical Interviews** - We gather information about developmental history, current functioning, and family history
2. **Standardized Testing** - Using validated measures specifically sensitive to ADHD in females
3. **Behavioral Observations** - Assessing attention, focus, and executive functioning in real-time
4. **Rating Scales** - Collecting information from multiple sources including parents, teachers, and self-reports
5. **Differential Diagnosis** - Carefully distinguishing ADHD from other conditions that may present similarly

## Benefits of Early Identification and Treatment

Early identification and appropriate intervention for girls with ADHD can:

- Prevent academic underachievement
- Reduce risk for anxiety and depression
- Improve self-esteem and self-confidence
- Enhance social relationships
- Develop effective coping strategies
- Provide appropriate accommodations for school or work
