## Spotlight on ADHD in Girls

A niche area of our expertise is in the assessment and diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in girls. This is an area that has, unfortunately, been underrepresented in research and clinical practice. Girls often display ADHD symptoms differently than boys, and hence, we provide specialized evaluations to identify ADHD, factoring in the unique ways it may manifest in female patients. The goal is to achieve a holistic understanding of each girl's strengths and challenges, and to support them in unlocking their full potential.

Contact us if you are concerned your daughter has ADHD, you yourself might have it, if you are a college student who has gone under the radar for your ADHD, or if you are a parent of a girl with ADHD.
