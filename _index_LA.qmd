### Learning Disability Testing

Complete psychoeducational evaluations for dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, and processing disorders. We identify specific learning challenges and strengths to guide intervention using the latest diagnostic instruments. Our detailed analysis examines phonological processing, reading fluency, math reasoning, and writing skills to pinpoint specific learning disorders. Reports include recommendations for IEP/504 plans, accommodations, and evidence-based interventions. Essential for academic success.

### IQ & Cognitive Testing

Comprehensive intellectual assessments for giftedness, cognitive delays, or understanding overall abilities.

Results include percentile ranks and age equivalents that are clearly explained. Helpful for school placement, twice-exceptional identification, and understanding your child's unique learning profile.

## Pediatric & Adolescent Services

### [ADHD Evaluations for Girls and Young Women](adhd-in-girls/index.qmd)

Specialized assessment for female-identifying individuals from preschool through young adulthood. Our female-focused ADHD evaluations recognize the unique presentation of symptoms in girls and women, which often includes inattentiveness without hyperactivity, social challenges, emotional dysregulation, and anxiety. We identify how hormonal fluctuations and societal expectations may mask or exacerbate symptoms, providing gender-informed diagnosis and recommendations.

### [Psychodiagnostic and Academic Testing](testing-accommodations/index.qmd)

Comprehensive evaluation of learning and medical disabilities that require accommodations for high-stakes testing situations (e.g., SAT, ACT, MCAT, LSAT, GRE). Our evaluations meet strict documentation requirements for College Board, ACT, AAMC, and other testing organizations. We provide detailed evidence of functional limitations and specific accommodation recommendations with appropriate clinical justification.

## Forensic Services

### [Independent Medical Exams (IME)](independent-medical-exam/index.qmd)

Dr. Trampush provides thorough evaluations that stand up to legal scrutiny, with experience in depositions, trial testimony, and medical-legal reporting.

### [Mental Health Diversion](independent-medical-exam/index.qmd#mental-health-diversion/)

Specialized neuropsychological evaluations for California's Mental Health Diversion program (PC 1001.36) that can help eligible defendants receive treatment instead of incarceration. Our assessments determine if a mental disorder was a significant factor in the alleged offense, evaluate treatment responsivity, and assess public safety considerations. Dr. Trampush provides court-ready documentation with specific treatment recommendations that meet legal requirements for diversion eligibility.

## Adult Services

### [Adult-Onset ADHD](adult-onset-adhd/index.qmd)

Focused assessment for ADHD that emerges or is first recognized in adulthood. Our evaluations address the unique challenges of adult ADHD, including executive function difficulties affecting career performance, time management, organization, and relationships. We differentiate between true adult-onset ADHD and similar conditions or undiagnosed childhood ADHD, providing practical strategies for workplace functioning and daily life management.

### [General Neuropsychology](adult-neuropsychology/index.qmd)

Comprehensive cognitive assessments for adults with memory concerns, executive functioning difficulties, processing speed changes, or other cognitive symptoms. Our evaluations examine multiple domains including attention, learning, memory, language, visuospatial skills, and executive functions.

## Our Approach: Data-Driven Neuropsychology

We utilize advanced data analytics and visualization techniques to transform complex assessment results into clear, meaningful insights. Our approach includes:

- **Comprehensive data integration** — We analyze patterns across multiple tests, questionnaires, and observations to identify cognitive strengths and weaknesses that might be missed in traditional reporting.

- **Advanced statistical methods** — Using normative comparisons and specialized algorithms to determine if performance patterns are clinically significant or within expected ranges.

- **Interactive visualizations** — Custom-designed charts and graphs that make complex cognitive profiles easy to understand, helping families see relationships between different abilities.

- **Translational reporting** — Converting technical findings into practical, actionable recommendations tailored to home, school, work, and community settings.

This data-driven approach allows us to detect subtle patterns that might otherwise be missed and provides you with clearer understanding of cognitive strengths and challenges. The result is more precise diagnosis and more effective, personalized recommendations.
