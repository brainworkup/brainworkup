Columbia Psychiatry’s Neuropsychological Evaluation Service is dedicated to identifying what prevents an individual from accessing their potential, as well as to better understand their specific strengths, areas of growth, and learning needs. Our team is comprised of experts in neuropsychology who evaluate preschool children through adults. Through these assessments, our experts are able to develop a comprehensive profile of one’s learning style along with targeted recommendations. Our team conducts evaluations using a developmental framework and strengths-based approach in order to effectively identify areas of growth.

Who We Serve
Our team works with individuals who are struggling to meet the demands of school/work or have challenges at home due to behavioral, academic or emotional difficulties. Our goal is to identify their strengths and challenges in order to make recommendations for the right interventions and services that can help them experience and maintain success. Each individual is unique, so we look for solutions that are right for each person or whole family.

Our Team
Our pediatric neuropsychology team is comprised of experts in school psychology, clinical psychology, and neuropsychology. They have specialized training in understanding brain development and how brain dysfunction may relate to problems at school, work, home, or with peers. Our experts help individuals understand the source of their difficulties, whether it is a learning disability, the effects of a medical condition, autism spectrum disorder, or another neurodevelopmental condition, such as a motor, language, or attention-based limitation. After the evaluation is completed, our providers are also equipped as needed to consult with school-based teams and other providers regarding academic and clinical interventions.

Our Program
Through our neuropsychological evaluations, we aim to pinpoint specific areas of growth that inform the best treatment for the individual and their family. We connect directly with school personnel, referring physicians, therapists, and other professionals involved in an individual’s care to ensure all providers are working collaboratively on a path to success.

A neuropsychological evaluation consists of several parts that may vary based on
the reason for an evaluation. Typically, an evaluation includes an intake
session, sessions for the neuropsychological testing, and a feedback session.

Intake
The intake is a chance for the neuropsychologist to learn more about why you or
your child was referred for an evaluation prior to initiating testing. This is
an opportunity for the individual or parent/guardian to provide information
regarding developmental, medical, educational, and psychological history. It
also is a good opportunity to ask any questions about the evaluation process.
This meeting usually takes one-to-two hours.

Neuropsychological Testing
Testing usually occurs over the span of two to three days, though some
re-evaluations or brief evaluations take only one day to complete. For children,
the first day of testing is probably the first time the neuropsychologist is
meeting your child, so the neuropsychologist will spend time at the beginning of
the session answering any questions your child may have and help put them at
ease for the testing process. Depending on your child’s age, testing may last a
full school day (9:00am-3:00pm) or half day (9:00am-12:00pm). Testing involves
completing various tasks that may involve answering questions, solving puzzles,
drawing, and/or filling out questionnaires. Given the length of testing
sessions, there are typically numerous breaks throughout the day, as well as a
longer break for lunch.

School Observation
In some circumstances, it is helpful to observe students in their learning
environment. The need for this observation is usually reviewed with the parent
during the intake or after the first testing appointment and depends on
accessibility to the school (*restrictions apply during the 2020-2021 school
year due to COVID-19).

Feedback
Results of the evaluation and associated recommendations will be reviewed during
the feedback session with you or the parent/guardian. With consent, results can
also be shared with others (e.g., school, other professionals). If appropriate
given their age and level of functioning, youth also may be included in part of
the feedback session. You will be provided with a written report summarizing the
evaluation following the date of feedback.

Ongoing Consultation
Often the neuropsychologist will continue to work with the individual and their
family to provide ongoing support. This may include working with other members
of the individual’s treatment team to ensure continuity of care and
implementation of recommendations from the evaluation. For youth, some
neuropsychologists may work closely with school personnel to help provide
appropriate educational programs. This can include connecting families with
educational advocates/attorneys, helping families find an appropriate school to
meet their child’s needs, consulting with school personnel on how to address
difficulties in the classroom, or attending Individualized Education Program
(IEP) or impartial hearing meetings.

Sample Evaluation Schedule
At the intake appointment, you will schedule subsequent testing sessions with
your provider. Testing days may occur consecutively within one week or during
different weeks, depending on provider and patient availability. Keep in mind
that this is a sample schedule and adjustments may occur based on the referral
question (e.g., shorter testing days, more than two testing days).
