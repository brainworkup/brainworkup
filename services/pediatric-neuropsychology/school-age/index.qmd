## Elementary School (Ages 6-12)

Adult-like neurocognitive abilities begin to materialize between the ages of 7-12 years during elementary school.  A baseline neurocognitive evaluation obtained during childhood can thus reassure parents and teachers that a child is developing as expected, as well as help identify and monitor neurodevelopmental concerns.  If we suspect any problems, we can then make recommendations for intervention in a timely manner.  Further, assessing children requires developmental issues be taken into consideration when interpreting a childâ€™s performance: many factors can influence a childâ€™s developmental maturation including genetics, medical history, home and family environment, behavioral problems, and sociocultural factors.  We can help parents understand these issues in the context of their childâ€™s abilities and limitations, and assist in monitoring your childâ€™s development during this critical period.
