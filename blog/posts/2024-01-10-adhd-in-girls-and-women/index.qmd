## Joey's Mom

My mom Luci is the most ADHD person I know. She is a wonderful person, but she still
hasn't stopped talking since the day I was born. She has had I don't even know
how many career changes, started and stopped multiple academic programs, and
might actually be the nicest person you have ever met.

## Reading books

I almost fell over when, maybe about 7-8 years ago, my mom revealed to me the
following: she had never read a book cover to cover in her entire life. Not only
that, she said she usually reads the first few pages of a book, then loses
interest, can't wait to find out what happens, and skips a few hundred pages and
reads the last page to find out what happened. She buys a lot of books and has a
lot of books on her bookshelf.

It would be funny if it wasn't so sad (actually, it's still pretty funny).

That's what the ADHD brain is like. It's not that you can't read, it's that you
don't enjoy reading because it's too slow, or you get too distracted, or you
don't have the patience to methodically traverse the story details.

## Driving cars

When my mom turned 16, she got her driver's license and a 1957 red Corvette. As
the story goes, she got something like 12 speeding tickets in that first year.
She just told me recently about having to go to court around that time. My
grandma had to take her. She said the judge scared her so badly that she
eventually slowed down. She still isn't the best driver today because because of
"stimulus boundness," but at least she drivers slower.

## Stimulus boundness

Stimulus boundness is a term that describes the tendency for people with ADHD to
be overly focused on the most salient stimulus in their environment. Or the
least salient. Or the most irrelevant. Or basically anything that isn't the
thing they should be focusing on.
