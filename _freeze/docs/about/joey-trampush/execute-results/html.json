Trampush, Ph.D., is the founder and chief neuropsychologist at BrainWorkup, LLC, and an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and the Behavioral Sciences at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. With over two decades of experience in pediatric neuropsychology, Dr. Trampush specializes in integrating molecular genetics with neuropsychology to understand behavior and psychiatric illness risk. His clinical expertise focuses on evaluating and diagnosing cognitive, learning, and emotional difficulties in children and young adults. He conducts research in molecular genetics, neuropsychology, neurodevelopment, and data science, aimed at enhancing our comprehension of psychiatric conditions and developmental trajectories.\"\nhide-description: true\ntags:\n  - neuropsychology\n  - Joey Trampush\n  - brainworkup\n  - brain work-up\nformat: \n  html:\n    linkcolor: \"#02577B\"\nabout:\n  template: solana\n  image: \"jwt.webp\"\nsidebar: true\n---  \n\n\nJoey is the founder and chief neuropsychologist at\n[BrainWorkup, LLC](https://brainworkup.org). Dr. Trampush is an Assistant\nProfessor\nof [Psychiatry and the Behavioral Sciences](https://keck.usc.edu/psychiatry/) at the Keck School of Medicine of\nUSC and\na practicing pediatric neuropsychologist with more than 20 years of experience in the\nfield. Dr. Trampush's expertise lies in the intersection of neuropsychology and genetics.\n\n## Education\n\n- **Ph.D., Clinical Neuropsychology (2010)**\n  - CUNY Graduate Center  \n\n- **M.Phil., Clinical Neuropsychology (2008)**\n  - CUNY Graduate Center  \n\n- **M.A., Clinical Neuropsychology (2007)**\n  - CUNY Queens College  \n\n- **B.A., Psychology, Minor: Sociology (2000)**\n  - Bowling Green State University\n\n## Specialization and Expertise\n\nAs a clinician, my expertise lies in developmental neuropsychology, where I focus on diagnosing cognitive, learning, and emotional difficulties. My primary goal is to provide diagnostic clarity for children and young adults, helping them gain a deeper understanding of themselves and their potential.\n\n## Research Interests\n\nAs a researcher, Dr. Trampush operates at the confluence of neuropsychology and genetics, striving to comprehend how molecular genetics influence behavior and the risk for psychiatric illness. His approach is grounded in the utilization of open-source data science tools, allowing him to delve into the complex interactions between genetics and neuropsychology.\n\n- **Molecular Genetics:** Exploring the genetic underpinnings of behavior and mental health.\n\n- **Neuropsychology:** Delving into the cognitive aspects of mental health conditions.\n\n- **Neurodevelopment:** Understanding how the brain develops and changes from childhood into adulthood.\n\n- **Data Science:** Utilizing data-driven approaches to enrich our understanding of psychiatric conditions.\n\n\n## Contact Me\n\nMy work offers a unique glimpse into the intersection of\nneuropsychology and genetics, providing valuable insights into the complex\ninteractions of the human mind. If you would like to learn more about my work\nand our neuropsychology practice, please send an e-mail to [info@brainworkup.org](mailto:joey.trampush@brainworkup.org).\n\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../logo3.svg){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n",
