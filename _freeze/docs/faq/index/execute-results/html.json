Our mission is to better educate our community about neurocognitive functioning and the importance of monitoring our own brain health.  We are trained in developmental neuropsychology, and as such, have the capacity to evaluate anyone in any stage of life, from children to teens to older adults.\n\nYour initial evaluation will serve as a baseline benchmark of neurocognitive functioning.  Any follow-up evaluations you undergo here or elsewhere can then be compared to your baseline results in order to track changes in neurocognitive functions over time.  Serial evaluations are often of clinical value.  Using these quantitative test instruments, we can evaluate the effects of a particular treatment, surgical procedure or passage of time; and monitor recovery, deterioration or stabilization of function.  Importantly, we only use evidence-based tests grounded in contemporary neuroscientific research.\n\nPerformance on the neurocognitive tests that we use has remarkable predictive value across a diverse range of social, health and behavioral outcomes (Deary et al., 2011).  As examples, neurocognitive performance has been shown to be a better predictor of mortality from heart disease than smoking, blood glucose and cholesterol (Batty et al., 2008), can predict how long people live (Deary, 2008), and is associated with educational attainment and earned income (Johnson et al., 2009).  Furthermore, deficits in neurocognitive performance are pervasive in most psychiatric (e.g., ADHD and depression) and neurologic (e.g., dementia and Parkinson’s disease) disorders (Millan et al., 2012).  As such, the results of your workup will allow us to provide you with objective information for improving and/or maintaining your cognitive and emotional well being.\n\n## What is a neuropsychological evaluation?\n\nOur evaluations typically include:\n\n- A clinical interview to gather background information on psychological, medical, educational, and social aspects, alongside current cognitive and psychological functioning.\n- Review of relevant medical, psychological, and educational records for a comprehensive understanding of your psychological and academic history.\n- Administration of psychological and neuropsychological tests to assess various cognitive and educational aspects, including:\n  - Intellectual abilities\n  - Academic skills (reading, writing, spelling, math)\n  - Executive functions (reasoning, problem-solving)\n  - Attention and concentration\n  - Language and communication\n  - Visual-spatial abilities\n  - Memory\n  - Motor and sensory skills\n  - Emotional and personality assessment\n\nFollowing the evaluation, we will compile a detailed report integrating our findings. This report will be provided to you, your school, and any relevant organizations for academic accommodations. Additionally, a feedback session will be conducted to discuss the results and treatment recommendations. This evaluation aims to identify dyslexia and facilitate necessary academic support.\n\n## Our Objective\n\nOur primary objective is to deliver comprehensive, evidence-based\nneuropsychological evaluations for children, adolescents, and adults. We excel in\nidentifying and proposing solutions for a multitude of conditions, including but\nnot limited to ADHD, learning disabilities such as dyslexia, autism spectrum\ndisorders and more.\n\nUnderstanding and monitoring neurocognitive functioning in everyone is critical to improving health outcomes as a society.  For these reasons, we want you to become an advocate of your own brain health.  Our goal is to have this fundamental medical data be available to anyone of any age, easy to get, affordable to all, and part of your regular health record.\n\n## Our Professional Services\n\n- **Comprehensive Neuropsychological Evaluations:** We conduct meticulous evaluations to determine cognitive strengths and weaknesses.\n\n- **Consultation and Proposals:** Customized strategies and assistance for parents and educators.\n\n- **Follow-up and Assistance:** Persistent support and follow-up services, tailored to the individual needs of each patient.\n\n## Fee Structure\n\nThe cost for evaluations varies based on the services required. A standard neuropsychological evaluation may range from $2200-3500, contingent upon referral questions and various other factors. We encourage you to contact our office for further information tailored to your specific situation.\n\nThe fee for intervention services and whether the intervention is a covered insurance benefit differ by the type of intervention and a patient’s specific insurance plan. We advise you to reach out to our office with any queries.\n\n## Payment Procedure\n\n### Insurance Coverage\n\nNumerous insurance companies provide coverage for neuropsychological\nevaluations. We recommend that you verify with your insurance provider to\nascertain your benefits. If applicable, you will be expected to fulfill\ninsurance deductibles at the time of service. Our office can furnish you with\nmore detailed information.\n\n### Referrals\n\nIt is imperative that you (1) ascertain whether your insurance necessitates a referral and (2) ensure you have procured a referral prior to your scheduled appointment with one of our doctors. Referrals typically come with an expiration date and a limited number of visits, hence, it is crucial to track the dates and visits. Our office will not accommodate a patient who does not possess a valid referral.\n\n### Authorizations\n\nIn case your insurance company mandates authorization for a neuropsychological evaluation, we will complete the necessary paperwork subsequent to the consultation visit. If your doctor is not an “in network provider,” you will need to provide us with the required documents. Authorizations for initial consult visits, if necessary, must be procured through your regular doctor or specialist.\n\nPlease note that school advocacy is not a benefit covered by insurance plans. The fee is $300 for the initial hour and $75 for each succeeding 15 minutes.\n\n### Payments\n\nWe accept cash, checks, Venmo, Zelle, MasterCard, and Visa.\n\n### Returned Checks\n\nShould a check be returned, your account will be charged a $25 fee for each occurrence. Furthermore, you will be requested to bring cash to our office to cover the returned check fee.\n\n---\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../logo3.svg){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n",
