It offers a potential lifeline for individuals whose mental disorders may have played a significant role in their alleged criminal activities. Instead of facing the traditional punitive measures, these individuals are given the opportunity to complete a treatment program.\nThe benefits of this approach are two-fold. If the accused completes the treatment, not only will the criminal charges be dismissed, but their arrest record will also be sealed. This allows for a fresh start, free from the stigma of a criminal record.",

    "section": "Key Aspects of Senate Bill 215:",
    "text": "Key Aspects of Senate Bill 215:\n\nEligibility and Exclusions: Defendants charged with either a felony or misdemeanor can qualify for mental health diversion, except for certain serious crimes. These ineligible crimes include murder, voluntary manslaughter, rape, lewd acts on a child under 14, assault with intent to commit rape, sodomy, or oral copulation, continuous sexual abuse of a child, and certain violations related to weapons of mass destruction​​.\nMental Disorders Criteria: To qualify, defendants must suffer from a mental disorder as specified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), excluding Antisocial Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Pedophilia. Common qualifying conditions include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder​.\nProgram Duration and Requirements: The diversion program can last up to two years, during which the defendant must agree to participate, waive their right to a speedy trial, and comply with all treatment program requirements. A qualified mental health professional must evaluate and conclude that the defendant will benefit from treatment. Additionally, the court must determine that the individual will not pose an unreasonable risk to public safety​​.\nTreatment Programs: The program can include inpatient or outpatient treatment, and may also encompass alcohol or drug treatment. The treatment can be funded by private or public sources, and regular progress reports must be provided to the court, the defense, and the prosecutor​​.\nOutcome upon Completion: If the defendant successfully completes the treatment program, the charges are dismissed, and the arrest record is sealed and destroyed, effectively erasing the incident from the defendant’s record. However, there are exceptions where the sealed records can be accessed, such as for peace officer applications or by criminal justice agencies​​.\nDistinction from PEN 1001.36: Senate Bill 215 also established PEN 1001.82, which differs from the original mental health diversion program under PEN 1001.36. The diversion under PC 1001.82 is only available for misdemeanors or felonies punishable in county jails, not state prisons. Certain felonies, such as DUI offenses causing injuries, joyriding, manslaughter, drug crimes, gun crimes, and child pornography, may not qualify for the diversion program under PEN 1001.82​​​​.\nOverall Impact: This program aims to provide defendants with the necessary mental health treatment and counseling, potentially avoiding jail time for crimes committed as a result of their mental illness​​.",

We work closely with the client, their family, their mental health treatment providers, and their attorney to conduct a comprehensive mental health diversion evaluation.\nOur in-depth assessment is designed to answer the critical questions related to the mental health diversion criteria. This includes:\n\nConfirming if the defendant suffers from a mental disorder. It’s important to note that Antisocial Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Pedophilic Disorder are excluded from this category.\nDetermining if the mental disorder played a significant role in the defendant’s involvement in the alleged crime.\nEvaluating whether the defendant’s symptoms that may have motivated the criminal behavior would respond positively to mental health treatment.\nEstablishing whether the defendant agrees to comply with the treatment as a condition of diversion.\nAssessing if the defendant, if treated in the community, will pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, as defined in PC 1170.18.\n\nBy providing these evaluations, we hope to contribute to a more understanding and compassionate approach to criminal justice, where mental health is given the consideration it deserves.",

    "text": "Raising a child is a journey filled with wonder, milestones, and sometimes, a healthy dose of confusion. One of the most fascinating aspects of this journey is the incredible transformation happening inside your child’s head – their brain is rapidly developing, shaping who they are and laying the foundation for their future.\nAs a parent, understanding this development can be both empowering and reassuring. It allows you to see beyond tantrums and meltdowns, recognizing them as natural steps in the brain’s complex dance. So, let’s grab a metaphorical flashlight and explore the key stages of brain development:\n\n\nImagine a construction site – that’s what’s happening in your baby’s brain. Billions of neurons are forming connections, creating the intricate pathways for learning and processing information. This is why play, interaction, and positive experiences are so crucial. Every coo, every giggle, every shared story strengthens these connections, laying the groundwork for future cognitive abilities.\n\n\n\nThink of this stage as a playground for the brain. Between the ages of 3 and 5, the prefrontal cortex, responsible for planning, decision-making, and impulse control, is rapidly developing. This is why imaginative play, with its emphasis on storytelling and pretend scenarios, is so important. It allows children to experiment with different roles, practice self-regulation, and build essential life skills.\n\n\n\nFrom building blocks to lego castles, the brain is now ready for more complex learning. This is where formal education comes in, but remember, it’s not just about memorizing facts. The brain is still forming connections, particularly in areas like language, memory, and problem-solving. Encourage curiosity, ask open-ended questions, and celebrate mistakes as learning opportunities.\n\n\n\nHold on tight, because the teenage brain is a rollercoaster! Hormones are surging, emotions are intense, and the prefrontal cortex is still under construction. This can lead to impulsiveness, risk-taking behavior, and emotional volatility. However, it’s also a time of incredible creativity, independence, and self-discovery. Provide support, set clear boundaries, and encourage open communication. Remember, the storm will eventually pass, leaving behind a stronger, more resilient brain.\n\n\nEvery child develops at their own pace. Don’t compare your child to others – their brain is on its own unique journey. Provide a safe, nurturing environment that fosters exploration, learning, and positive relationships. Be patient, consistent, and loving – your presence is the most powerful tool in shaping your child’s brain. Understanding brain development can ease anxieties, fuel your parenting decisions, and most importantly, strengthen the bond between you and your child. So, embrace the wonder, celebrate the milestones, and remember, you’re playing a vital role in building the incredible brain that will shape their future.\nThis is just the beginning of the exploration! Here are some additional resources to keep your brain-curious mind happy:\n\nBooks: “The Developing Brain” by David Eagleman, “The Whole-Brain Child” by Daniel J.

Many ADHD symptoms, such as high activity levels, difficulty remaining still for long periods of time, and limited attention span are common from time to time in everyone. The difference in individuals with ADHD is that their inattention, poor impulse control, and hyperactivity are substantially greater than expected for their age and cause distress and/or problems functioning at home, at school, at work, and/or with friends.",

    "text": "Payment Procedure\n\nInsurance Coverage\nMost insurance companies have what are called “Out of Network” benefits that may cover a portion of the cost of the evaluation if we do not participate in your insurance. You should check with your insurance company to determine what out of network benefits you may be entitled to and to make sure that neuropsychological testing is a covered service. It is also important to ask your insurer whether pre-authorization from the insurance company is necessary before services are provided. We will provide you with information regarding services and fees to assist you with filing out-of-network claims with your insurance company.\n\n\nReferrals\nIt is imperative that you (1) ascertain whether your insurance necessitates a referral and (2) ensure you have procured a referral prior to your scheduled appointment with one of our doctors. Referrals typically come with an expiration date and a limited number of visits, hence, it is crucial to track the dates and visits. Our office will not accommodate a patient who does not possess a valid referral.\n\n\nAuthorizations\nIn case your insurance company mandates authorization for a neuropsychological evaluation, we will complete the necessary paperwork subsequent to the consultation visit. If your doctor is not an “in network provider,” you will need to provide us with the required documents. Authorizations for initial consult visits, if necessary, must be procured through your regular doctor or specialist.\nPlease note that school advocacy is not a benefit covered by insurance plans. The fee is $300 for the initial hour and $75 for each succeeding 15 minutes.\n\n\nPayments\nWe accept cash, checks, Venmo, Zelle, MasterCard, and Visa.\n\n\nReturned Checks\nShould a check be returned, your account will be charged a $25 fee for each occurrence.

Dyslexia is a common condition: some experts believe 5-10% of people have it; others say as many as 17% of people show signs of reading challenges. Dyslexia is formally classified as a specific learning disability in reading. People with dyslexia have trouble reading at a good pace and without mistakes. They may also have a hard time with reading comprehension, spelling, and writing. Importantly, these challenges are not a problem with intelligence.\n\nApproximately 24% of individuals diagnosed with dyslexia are able to achieve reading skills commensurate with nondyslexic peers. A concept in the research literature is one of “compensated dyslexia”(Viersen et al. 2016), which is used to describe these individuals because they use strengths in other areas to compensate for deficits in reading. Dyslexia is underidentified in this population because the dyslexia can be masked by strengths in vocabulary and intelligence, making it especially difficult to identify in high-achieving individuals.",

However, preschoolers don’t have the same skill-set as older children, adolescents and adults, so the evaluation of preschool-aged children requires special training.\nFor several years, we were involved in two major research studies of preschool-aged children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that were funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). The first study was the NIMH Preschool ADHD Treatment Study (PATS) [link], and more recently, the Queens College Preschool Project (QCPP) [link].\nAmongst several important findings, we discovered that changes in neurocognitive development predicted improvements (or lack thereof) in ADHD symptoms over a period of three years [link]. Thus, if you are interested in having your preschooler evaluated to establish his/her baseline level of neurocognitive development, we are well trained to work with this unique population.",

Emerging adulthood is the time when we start to clear past the struggles of adolescence, start to feel responsible for ourselves, find our personal identity, and do so while we are still closely tied to our parents and family.
