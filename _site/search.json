    "text": "Overview\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a lifelong disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention (not being able to keep focus), hyperactivity (excess movement that is not fitting to the setting) and impulsivity (hasty acts that occur in the moment without thought). Many ADHD symptoms, such as high activity levels, difficulty remaining still for long periods of time, and limited attention span are common from time to time in everyone. The difference in individuals with ADHD is that their inattention, poor impulse control, and hyperactivity are substantially greater than expected for their age and cause distress and/or problems functioning at home, at school, at work, and/or with friends.",

Because most early ADHD research focused on hyperactive boys, the diagnostic criteria—and the clinical instincts built around them—were never designed to catch how ADHD typically shows up in females. The result: countless girls, teens, young women, and adult women have gone undiagnosed, often for years, while quietly struggling with attention, organization, and emotional regulation behind a mask of high effort and self-doubt.\nOur practice focuses specifically on closing that gap. We provide thorough, evidence-based ADHD evaluations tailored to the ways attention and executive functioning challenges actually present in female patients—including the subtler inattentive symptoms, the internalized coping strategies, and the co-occurring anxiety or low self-esteem that so often obscure the underlying ADHD. Every assessment is designed to capture the full picture: cognitive strengths, areas of difficulty, and a clear path forward.",

Any follow-up evaluations you undergo here or elsewhere can then be compared to your baseline results in order to track changes in neurocognitive functions over time. Serial evaluations are often of clinical value. Using these quantitative test instruments, we can evaluate the effects of a particular treatment, surgical procedure or passage of time; and monitor recovery, deterioration or stabilization of function.

    "text": "Payment Procedure\n\nInsurance Coverage\nMost insurance companies have what are called “Out of Network” benefits that may cover a portion of the cost of the evaluation if we do not participate in your insurance. You should check with your insurance company to determine what out of network benefits you may be entitled to and to make sure that neuropsychological testing is a covered service. It is also important to ask your insurer whether pre-authorization from the insurance company is necessary before services are provided. We will provide you with information regarding services and fees to assist you with filing out-of-network claims with your insurance company.\n\n\nReferrals\nIt is important that you (1) know whether your insurance needs a referral for neuropsychological testing, and (2) ensure you have procured a referral prior to your scheduled appointment. Referrals typically come with an expiration date and a limited number of visits, hence, it is crucial to track the dates and visits.\n\n\nAuthorizations\nIn case your insurance company requires authorization for a neuropsychological evaluation, we will complete the necessary paperwork subsequent to the consultation visit. If your doctor is not an “in network provider,” you will need to provide us with the required documents. Authorizations for initial consult visits, if necessary, must be procured through your regular doctor or specialist.\n\n\nPayments\nWe accept cash, checks, Venmo, Zelle, MasterCard, Visa and AMEX. Payment is due at the time of service. We will provide you with a detailed “super bill” that you can submit to your insurance company for reimbursement.

Dyslexia is a common condition: some experts believe 5-10% of people have it; others say as many as 17% of people show signs of reading challenges. Dyslexia is formally classified as a specific learning disability in reading. People with dyslexia have trouble reading at a good pace and without mistakes. They may also have a hard time with reading comprehension, spelling, and writing. Importantly, these challenges are not a problem with intelligence.\n\nApproximately 24% of individuals diagnosed with dyslexia are able to achieve reading skills commensurate with nondyslexic peers. A concept in the research literature is one of “compensated dyslexia”(Viersen et al. 2016), which is used to describe these individuals because they use strengths in other areas to compensate for deficits in reading. Dyslexia is underidentified in this population because the dyslexia can be masked by strengths in vocabulary and intelligence, making it especially difficult to identify in high-achieving individuals.",

    "text": "Key Aspects of Senate Bill 215:\n\nEligibility and Exclusions: Defendants charged with either a felony or misdemeanor can qualify for mental health diversion, except for certain serious crimes. These ineligible crimes include murder, voluntary manslaughter, rape, lewd acts on a child under 14, assault with intent to commit rape, sodomy, or oral copulation, continuous sexual abuse of a child, and certain violations related to weapons of mass destruction​​.\nMental Disorders Criteria: To qualify, defendants must suffer from a mental disorder as specified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), excluding Antisocial Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Pedophilia. Common qualifying conditions include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder​.\nProgram Duration and Requirements: The diversion program can last up to two years, during which the defendant must agree to participate, waive their right to a speedy trial, and comply with all treatment program requirements. A qualified mental health professional must evaluate and conclude that the defendant will benefit from treatment. Additionally, the court must determine that the individual will not pose an unreasonable risk to public safety​​.\nTreatment Programs: The program can include inpatient or outpatient treatment, and may also encompass alcohol or drug treatment. The treatment can be funded by private or public sources, and regular progress reports must be provided to the court, the defense, and the prosecutor​​.\nOutcome upon Completion: If the defendant successfully completes the treatment program, the charges are dismissed, and the arrest record is sealed and destroyed, effectively erasing the incident from the defendant’s record. However, there are exceptions where the sealed records can be accessed, such as for peace officer applications or by criminal justice agencies​​.\nDistinction from PEN 1001.36: Senate Bill 215 also established PEN 1001.82, which differs from the original mental health diversion program under PEN 1001.36. The diversion under PC 1001.82 is only available for misdemeanors or felonies punishable in county jails, not state prisons. Certain felonies, such as DUI offenses causing injuries, joyriding, manslaughter, drug crimes, gun crimes, and child pornography, may not qualify for the diversion program under PEN 1001.82​​​​.\nOverall Impact: This program aims to provide defendants with the necessary mental health treatment and counseling, potentially avoiding jail time for crimes committed as a result of their mental illness​​.",

This includes:\n\nConfirming if the defendant suffers from a mental disorder. It’s important to note that Antisocial Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Pedophilic Disorder are excluded from this category.\nDetermining if the mental disorder played a significant role in the defendant’s involvement in the alleged crime.\nEvaluating whether the defendant’s symptoms that may have motivated the criminal behavior would respond positively to mental health treatment.\nEstablishing whether the defendant agrees to comply with the treatment as a condition of diversion.\nAssessing if the defendant, if treated in the community, will pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, as defined in PC 1170.18.\n\nBy providing these evaluations, we hope to contribute to a more understanding and compassionate approach to criminal justice, where mental health is given the consideration it deserves.",

It’s the spotlight that illuminates the stage for the rest of the cognitive processes to perform.\nWorking Memory: This function is akin to the stagehand that keeps track of and manipulates information in real-time. It’s the mental notepad we use to hold onto thoughts, instructions, or plans.\nPlanning: This is the strategic mastermind that organizes steps and resources necessary to accomplish a goal. It’s the scriptwriter that charts the course of the cognitive performance.\nInhibition: The ability to suppress impulsive responses is essential for maintaining order and coherence. It acts as the stage manager, ensuring that the performance doesn’t go off-script due to unexpected interruptions.\nEmotion Regulation: This is the emotional intelligence of the cognitive processes. It handles the management of emotions to achieve goals, complete tasks, or control and direct behavior. It’s the empathetic director that guides the emotional tone of the performance.",
