    "text": "Brain Maturational Changes\nYoung adults in their early 20s are in a period of “emerging adulthood” and face unique life challenges. Research has shown that emerging adulthood is a period of feeling “in-between” for most young adults. Emerging adulthood is the time when we start to clear past the struggles of adolescence, start to feel responsible for ourselves, find our personal identity, and do so while we are still closely tied to our parents and family. Importantly, many major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression surface during young adulthood, especially during the transition to college. If you are struggling with these issues, we can provide state-of-the-art evaluation of your neurocognitive functioning and provide recommendations for follow-up care if necessary.",

Common concerns are ADHD, learning difficulties such as dyslexia, substance abuse, or problems with depression and/or anxiety. While neurocognitive evaluation alone cannot confirm a complex psychiatric diagnosis, we can assess functioning in core areas such as attention, processing speed and memory to objectively identify your strengths as well as difficulties that might not otherwise be obvious.

However, preschoolers don’t have the same skill-set as older children, adolescents and adults, so the evaluation of preschool-aged children requires special training.\nFor several years, we were involved in two major research studies of preschool-aged children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that were funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). The first study was the NIMH Preschool ADHD Treatment Study (PATS) [link], and more recently, the Queens College Preschool Project (QCPP) [link].\nAmongst several important findings, we discovered that changes in neurocognitive development predicted improvements (or lack thereof) in ADHD symptoms over a period of three years [link].

Dyslexia is a common condition: some experts believe 5-10% of people have it; others say as many as 17% of people show signs of reading challenges. Dyslexia is formally classified as a specific learning disability in reading. People with dyslexia have trouble reading at a good pace and without mistakes. They may also have a hard time with reading comprehension, spelling, and writing. Importantly, these challenges are not a problem with intelligence.\n\nApproximately 24% of individuals diagnosed with dyslexia are able to achieve reading skills commensurate with nondyslexic peers. A concept in the research literature is one of “compensated dyslexia”(Viersen et al. 2016), which is used to describe these individuals because they use strengths in other areas to compensate for deficits in reading. Dyslexia is underidentified in this population because the dyslexia can be masked by strengths in vocabulary and intelligence, making it especially difficult to identify in high-achieving individuals.\n\nCommon complaints\n\nYou read at a pace that is noticeably slower than average\nYou struggled to gain proficiency in reading while in school\n\nYou often have to reread passages multiple times before understanding them\nWhen reading or writing, you often leave out certain letters or mix them up\nSpelling words incorrectly is something that happens frequently for you\nWhen attempting to read aloud, you find it difficult to correctly pronounce multi-syllabic words\nInstead of tackling longer books, you prefer to read magazines and shorter articles\nTo dodge reading-intensive tasks, you tend to avoid working on projects that require",

    "text": "BrainWorkup Neuropsychology, LLC is a pediatric and adult clinical neuropsychology practice. Our mission is to better educate our community about neurocognitive functioning and the importance of monitoring our own brain health. We are trained in developmental neuropsychology, and as such, have the capacity to evaluate anyone in any stage of life, from children to teens to older adults.\nYour initial evaluation will serve as a baseline benchmark of neurocognitive functioning. Any follow-up evaluations you undergo here or elsewhere can then be compared to your baseline results in order to track changes in neurocognitive functions over time. Serial evaluations are often of clinical value. Using these quantitative test instruments, we can evaluate the effects of a particular treatment, surgical procedure or passage of time; and monitor recovery, deterioration or stabilization of function. Importantly, we only use evidence-based tests grounded in contemporary neuroscientific research.\nPerformance on the neurocognitive tests that we use has remarkable predictive value across a diverse range of social, health and behavioral outcomes (Deary et al., 2011). As examples, neurocognitive performance has been shown to be a better predictor of mortality from heart disease than smoking, blood glucose and cholesterol (Batty et al., 2008), can predict how long people live (Deary, 2008), and is associated with educational attainment and earned income (Johnson et al., 2009). Furthermore, deficits in neurocognitive performance are pervasive in most psychiatric (e.g., ADHD and depression) and neurologic (e.g., dementia and Parkinson’s disease) disorders (Millan et al., 2012). As such, the results of your workup will allow us to provide you with objective information for improving and/or maintaining your cognitive and emotional well being.\n\n\n\nOur evaluations typically include:\n\nA clinical interview to gather background information on psychological, medical, educational, and social aspects, alongside current cognitive and psychological functioning.\nReview of relevant medical, psychological, and educational records for a comprehensive understanding of your psychological and academic history.\nAdministration of psychological and neuropsychological tests to assess various cognitive and educational aspects, including:\n\nIntellectual abilities\nAcademic skills (reading, writing, spelling, math)\nExecutive functions (reasoning, problem-solving)\nAttention and concentration\nLanguage and communication\nVisual-spatial abilities\nMemory\nMotor and sensory skills\nEmotional and personality assessment\n\n\nFollowing the evaluation, we will compile a detailed report integrating our findings. This report will be provided to you, your school, and any relevant organizations for academic accommodations. Additionally, a feedback session will be conducted to discuss the results and treatment recommendations. This evaluation aims to identify dyslexia and facilitate necessary academic support.\n\n\n\nOur primary objective is to deliver comprehensive, evidence-based neuropsychological evaluations for children, adolescents, and adults. We excel in identifying and proposing solutions for a multitude of conditions, including but not limited to ADHD, learning disabilities such as dyslexia, autism spectrum disorders and more.\nUnderstanding and monitoring neurocognitive functioning in everyone is critical to improving health outcomes as a society. For these reasons, we want you to become an advocate of your own brain health. Our goal is to have this fundamental medical data be available to anyone of any age, easy to get, affordable to all, and part of your regular health record.\n\n\n\n\nComprehensive Neuropsychological Evaluations: We conduct meticulous evaluations to determine cognitive strengths and weaknesses.\nConsultation and Proposals: Customized strategies and assistance for parents and educators.\nFollow-up and Assistance: Persistent support and follow-up services, tailored to the individual needs of each patient.\n\n\n\n\nThe cost for evaluations varies based on the services required. A standard neuropsychological evaluation may range from $2200-3500, contingent upon referral questions and various other factors. We encourage you to contact our office for further information tailored to your specific situation.\nThe fee for intervention services and whether the intervention is a covered insurance benefit differ by the type of intervention and a patient’s specific insurance plan. We advise you to reach out to our office with any queries.\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerous insurance companies provide coverage for neuropsychological evaluations. We recommend that you verify with your insurance provider to ascertain your benefits. If applicable, you will be expected to fulfill insurance deductibles at the time of service. Our office can furnish you with more detailed information.\n\n\n\nIt is imperative that you (1) ascertain whether your insurance necessitates a referral and (2) ensure you have procured a referral prior to your scheduled appointment with one of our doctors. Referrals typically come with an expiration date and a limited number of visits, hence, it is crucial to track the dates and visits. Our office will not accommodate a patient who does not possess a valid referral.\n\n\n\nIn case your insurance company mandates authorization for a neuropsychological evaluation, we will complete the necessary paperwork subsequent to the consultation visit. If your doctor is not an “in network provider,” you will need to provide us with the required documents. Authorizations for initial consult visits, if necessary, must be procured through your regular doctor or specialist.\nPlease note that school advocacy is not a benefit covered by insurance plans. The fee is $300 for the initial hour and $75 for each succeeding 15 minutes.\n\n\n\nWe accept cash, checks, Venmo, Zelle, MasterCard, and Visa.\n\n\n\nShould a check be returned, your account will be charged a $25 fee for each occurrence.

It offers a potential lifeline for individuals whose mental disorders may have played a significant role in their alleged criminal activities. Instead of facing the traditional punitive measures, these individuals are given the opportunity to complete a treatment program.\nThe benefits of this approach are two-fold. If the accused completes the treatment, not only will the criminal charges be dismissed, but their arrest record will also be sealed. This allows for a fresh start, free from the stigma of a criminal record.",

This includes:\n\nConfirming if the defendant suffers from a mental disorder. It’s important to note that Antisocial Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Pedophilic Disorder are excluded from this category.\nDetermining if the mental disorder played a significant role in the defendant’s involvement in the alleged crime.\nEvaluating whether the defendant’s symptoms that may have motivated the criminal behavior would respond positively to mental health treatment.\nEstablishing whether the defendant agrees to comply with the treatment as a condition of diversion.\nAssessing if the defendant, if treated in the community, will pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, as defined in PC 1170.18.\n\nBy providing these evaluations, we hope to contribute to a more understanding and compassionate approach to criminal justice, where mental health is given the consideration it deserves.\nTODO:",

    "section": "",
    "text": "What is non-verbal learning disorder? Child Mind Institute explains NLD symptoms, such as trouble understanding information, concepts, and ideas.\n\nThis is the first in a series of articles about non-verballearning disorder developed in collaboration with Winston Preparatory School, a New York area school that has taken a leading role in working with students with the disorder.\nWhen we think of learning disorders, we tend to think ofdyslexia and other disorders involving language—that is, kids who have trouble decoding language and learning to read.\nBut there is another, less well-known type of learning disorder that’s not about verbal communication—hence it’s called non-verbal learning disorder. You’ll see it referred to as NVLD or NLD. It isn’t an officialdiagnosis like ADHD and autism—in fact many kids who have non-verbal learning challenges have those diagnoses. But experts say focusing on NLD explains what’s happening with kids—and how to help them learn—better than those diagnoses.\n\n\nKids who have NLD do not have trouble decoding language, reading, or learning information in a rote way. As Scott Bezsylko, executive director of Winston Preparatory School, puts it, “Think of it as the opposite of dyslexia.” The problems these kids have involve, he says, all the other kinds of learning. “All the stuff that involves understanding information—relationships, concepts, ideas, patterns.”\nThese deficits—all things related to the right hemisphere of the brain—can affect a child’s ability to do a surprising variety of things. Physical coordination, social interaction, problem solving, organizing thoughts, planning—all these things can be challenging. They seem very different, but the unifying theme is that each requires the ability to recognize patterns or concepts and then apply them to new situations.\n\n\n\nThere are five areas in which children with NLD show weakness. Not all children have weaknesses in all areas.\n1. Visual and Spatial Awareness:\nMany kids with NLD have trouble understanding visual imagery. For example when they are asked to copy a shape like a cube they produce “profound distortions,” says Bezsylko. “These kids can’t accurately perceive the cube, the forms that make up the cube, and the relationships between them. Hence they can’t copy it.”\nThey also have difficulty evaluating visual-spatial information. This means they have trouble grasping the relationships between things they see and having a clear sense of where they are. This can make them physically awkward.\n2. Higher-Order Comprehension:\nHigher-order comprehension is the ability to identify the main idea in something, the details that support the main idea, and the relationships among them. This affects kids’ ability to comprehend reading, and write or tell a story effectively.\nIt also affects taking notes. Bezsylko observed that some kids essentially take down everything the teacher says because they don’t know what’s important and what not to take down. Other kids don’t know what’s important so they take down nothing, and people think they aren’t paying attention. Or they take down all the wrong things.\n3. Social Communication\nMost kids with non-verbal learning disorders have trouble reading emotion in facial cues and body language, so they often don’t know what’s going on in social interactions. They miss the social patterns that other kids pick up automatically, so they don’t know what’s appropriate behavior in a given situation.\nDifficulties with social communication is one reason why kids with NLD often focus—sometimes obsessively—on technology. “In chat rooms or in a video game they don’t have to deal with all the nonverbal stuff,” Bezsylko notes.\n4. Math Concepts\nMany kids with NLD are very good at rote learning, and they are able to do well in math just by memorizing data. But as they get older they struggle to solve more advanced mathematical problems that are based on recognizing concepts and patterns. Even with a problem they’ve seen before, if it’s approached differently or modified slightly, they have trouble recognizing it.\n5. Executive Functions\nExecutive functions are a set of skills we use to organize our thinking, plan and carry out actions, and figure out how to solve problems. Most kids with NLD have weaknesses in these organizing and planning functions. For instance they struggle with breaking down a project into smaller pieces, or conceiving steps that need to be taken to get something done.\n“These kids have trouble figuring things out—in fact they don’t really know what figuring something out means,” Bezsylko says. “We have to help them learn to do that—the step-by-step process you go through.”\n\n\n\nIn addition to the different combinations of symptoms, kids with NLD also vary along a spectrum of severity.\nOne the one hand there are kids who are extremely high-functioning but socially awkward, a little clumsy, disorganized—what Bezsylko calls “the absentminded professor type.” Other kids are more pervasively affected, and they function with more difficulty in many areas. “These kids often struggle to learn everything that isn’t rote or literal.”\nAt Winston Prep, a study of more than 100 students with NLD showed that there were 6 combinations of the 5 deficits. The largest group had all five of the deficits, but the second largest group had just two: social communication and executive functions.\n\n\n\nMany kids with NLD symptoms can do well enough in elementary school because they are very good at memorization and rote learning. It’s common for them to run into trouble around middle school, when their difficulty with the higher order reasoning—figuring out the main idea, the details, and the relationships—causes them to fall behind. “There’s a saying that in fifth grade you stop learning to read, and now you read to learn,” notes Bezsylko, “and that’s when these kids fall apart.” Historically, Winston Prep took kids in sixth through tenth grade; they’ve started to take some kids as young as fourth grade.\n“Almost all of these kids look inattentive and disorganized,” Bezsylko adds, “especially as they get older. The more that schoolwork, math concepts, and socialization become complex rather than rote, the more those difficulties start to show up.”\n\n\n\nNLD is not one of the official diagnoses mental health professionals and schools use to categorize kids with psychiatric or learning problems. Kids who have it usually have other diagnoses—often autism or ADHD. But while those diagnoses list their symptoms or behaviors, they don’t fully explain them, argues Bezsylko.\nFor instance, if a child is disorganized and inattentive, he is likely to be diagnosed withADHD. But he may well be disorganized and inattentive because he doesn’t understand what’s being discussed, what he reads, or the problem he’s been asked to solve. That’s where NLD comes in. “You can’t pay attention if you can’t understand,” notes Bezsylko.\nSimilarly, a child diagnosed withautism spectrum disorder will be described as having social and communication deficits. Those behaviors, too, can reflect NLD—not being able recognize patterns in facial expression, body language, and other forms of nonverbal communication can make kids unresponsive socially.\nTake the kids in the Winston Prep study who had all five of the deficits. Most of them had a diagnosis of either ADHD or autism spectrum disorder. “But those diagnoses don’t identify three important areas where they are struggling,” notes Bezsylko: “higher-order comprehension, math concepts, and visual and spatial relations. Unless their NLD is recognized, they’re not likely to get help that strengthens or compensates for weaknesses in those core areas.”\n\n\n\nWhat is non-verbal learning disorder?\nIs NLD on the autism spectrum?\nThis article was last reviewed or updated on October 30, 2023."
