## Brain Maturational Changes

Young adults in their early 20s are in a period of “emerging adulthood” and face unique life challenges.  Research has shown that emerging adulthood is a period of feeling “in-between” for most young adults.  Emerging adulthood is the time when we start to clear past the struggles of adolescence, start to feel responsible for ourselves, find our personal identity, and do so while we are still closely tied to our parents and family.  Importantly, many major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression surface during young adulthood, especially during the transition to college.  If you are struggling with these issues, we can provide state-of-the-art evaluation of your neurocognitive functioning and provide recommendations for follow-up care if necessary.

## Young Professionals

Successful professionals sometimes struggle with untreated mental health issues that can lead to feelings of underperformance at work.  Common concerns are ADHD, learning difficulties such as dyslexia, substance abuse, or problems with depression and/or anxiety.  While neurocognitive evaluation alone cannot confirm a complex psychiatric diagnosis, we can assess functioning in core areas such as attention, processing speed and memory to objectively identify your strengths as well as difficulties that might not otherwise be obvious.  Knowing your strengths and weakness may help increase productivity and improve work efficiency in the long run.
