## Overview of the Practice

BrainWorkup Neuropsychology, LLC is a pediatric and adult clinical neuropsychology practice. Our mission is to better educate our community about neurocognitive functioning and the importance of monitoring our own brain health. We are trained in developmental neuropsychology, and as such, have the capacity to evaluate anyone in any stage of life, from children to teens to older adults.

Your initial evaluation will serve as a baseline benchmark of neurocognitive functioning. Any follow-up evaluations you undergo here or elsewhere can then be compared to your baseline results in order to track changes in neurocognitive functions over time. Serial evaluations are often of clinical value. Using these quantitative test instruments, we can evaluate the effects of a particular treatment, surgical procedure or passage of time; and monitor recovery, deterioration or stabilization of function. Importantly, we only use evidence-based tests grounded in contemporary neuroscientific research.

## Real-World Applications

Performance on the neurocognitive tests that we use has remarkable predictive value across a diverse range of social, health and behavioral outcomes (Deary et al., 2011). As examples, neurocognitive performance has been shown to be a better predictor of mortality from heart disease than smoking, blood glucose and cholesterol (Batty et al., 2008), can predict how long people live (Deary, 2008), and is associated with educational attainment and earned income (Johnson et al., 2009). Furthermore, deficits in neurocognitive performance are pervasive in most psychiatric (e.g., ADHD and depression) and neurologic (e.g., dementia and Parkinson’s disease) disorders (Millan et al., 2012). As such, the results of your workup will allow us to provide you with objective information for improving and/or maintaining your cognitive and emotional well being.

## What is a Neuropsychological Evaluation?

Dr. Trampush contributed to this article explaining hat a neuropsychological
evaluation is and why it is important:

- [**What Is Neuropsychological Testing?**](https://internalmedicine.usc.edu/blog/what-is-neuropsychological-testing/)

### Our evaluations typically include:

- A neurobehavioral status exam and clinical interview to gather background information on psychological, medical, educational, and social aspects, alongside current cognitive and psychological functioning.
- Review of relevant medical, psychological, and educational records for a comprehensive understanding of your psychological and academic history.
- Administration of neurocognitive and neurobehavioral tests to assess strengths
and weaknesses, including:

  - General Cognitive Ability
  - Academic Skills (reading, writing, spelling, math)
  - Verbal/Language
  - Visual Perception/Construction
  - Attention/Executive
  - Memory
  - Sensorimotor
  - Social Cognition
  - ADHD/Executive Function
  - Emotional/Behavioral/Personality

Following the evaluation, we will compile a detailed report integrating our findings. This report will be provided to you, your school, and any relevant organizations for academic accommodations. Additionally, a feedback session will be conducted to discuss the results and treatment recommendations.

## Our Objective

Our primary objective is to deliver comprehensive, evidence-based
neuropsychological evaluations for children, adolescents, and adults. We excel in
identifying and proposing solutions for a multitude of conditions, including but
not limited to ADHD, learning disabilities such as dyslexia, autism spectrum
disorders and more.

Understanding and monitoring neurocognitive functioning in everyone is critical to improving health outcomes as a society.  For these reasons, we want you to become an advocate of your own brain health.  Our goal is to have this fundamental medical data be available to anyone of any age, easy to get, affordable to all, and part of your regular health record.

## Our Professional Services

- **Comprehensive Neuropsychological Evaluations:** We conduct meticulous evaluations to determine cognitive strengths and weaknesses.

- **Consultation and Proposals:** Customized strategies and assistance for parents and educators.

- **Follow-up and Assistance:** Persistent support and follow-up services, tailored to the individual needs of each patient.

## Fee Structure

The cost for evaluations varies based on the services required. A standard
pediatric neuropsychological evaluation may range from $2,500-4,000, contingent
upon referral questions and various other factors. Adult evaluations are
usually, but not always, less time and costs. We encourage you to contact
our office for further information tailored to your specific situation.

The fee for intervention services and whether the intervention is a covered
insurance benefit differ by the type of intervention and a patient’s specific
insurance plan. We advise you to reach out to our office with any queries.

## Payment Procedure

### Insurance Coverage

Most insurance companies have what are called “Out of Network” benefits that may cover a portion of the cost of the evaluation if we do not participate in your insurance. You should check with your insurance company to determine what out of network benefits you may be entitled to and to make sure that neuropsychological testing is a covered service. It is also important to ask your insurer whether pre-authorization from the insurance company is necessary before services are provided. We will provide you with information regarding services and fees to assist you with filing out-of-network claims with your insurance company.

### Referrals

It is important that you (1) know whether your insurance needs a referral for
neuropsychological testing, and (2) ensure you have procured a referral prior to your
scheduled appointment. Referrals typically come with an
expiration date and a limited number of visits, hence, it is crucial to track
the dates and visits.

### Authorizations

In case your insurance company requires authorization for a neuropsychological evaluation, we will complete the necessary paperwork subsequent to the consultation visit. If your doctor is not an “in network provider,” you will need to provide us with the required documents. Authorizations for initial consult visits, if necessary, must be procured through your regular doctor or specialist.

### Payments

We accept cash, checks, Venmo, Zelle, MasterCard, and Visa.

### Returned Checks

Should a check be returned, your account will be charged a $25 fee for each occurrence. Furthermore, you will be requested to bring cash to our office to cover the returned check fee.
