## Welcome! :wave:

I am the founder and chief neuropsychologist at [BrainWorkup Neuropsychology, LLC](https://brainworkup.org). I also hold a position as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Psychiatry and the Behavioral Sciences](https://keck.usc.edu/psychiatry/) at the [Keck School of Medicine of USC](https://keck.usc.edu/).

With nearly two decades of experience in both research and clinical practice, I have cultivated a unique expertise at the nexus of neuropsychology, psychiatric genetics, and data science. My journey has been marked by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and understanding.

In my capacity as a clinical pediatric neuropsychologist, I have dedicated over ten years to the evaluation and diagnosis of cognitive, learning, and emotional difficulties in children and young adults. Concurrently, my research has delved deep into the genetic foundations of behavior and mental health for over 15 years.

My contributions to the field are reflected in many high-impact peer-reviewed articles and book chapters that I have authored. I am also a recipient of funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

I maintain active memberships with esteemed organizations such as the [American
Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/), the [International
Neuropsychological Society](https://www.the-ins.org/), and the [Society for
Biological Psychiatry](https://www.sobp.org/). Lastly, I am a licensed
psychologist in the States of California and New York.

## Education/Training

- **Postdoctoral Fellowship, Psychiatric Genetics (2012)**, National Institute of Mental Health @ NIH, Bethesda, MD

- **Predoctoral Internship, Pediatric Neuropsychology (2009)**, Henry Ford
Hospital, Detroit, MI (APA accredited)

- **Ph.D., Clinical Neuropsychology (2010)**, CUNY Graduate Center, New York, NY 

- **M.Phil., Clinical Neuropsychology (2008)**, CUNY Graduate Center, New York, NY

- **M.A., Clinical Neuropsychology (2007)**, CUNY Queens College, Flushing, NY  

- **B.A., Psychology, Minor: Sociology (2000)**, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH


## Specialization and Expertise

As a clinician, my expertise lies in developmental neuropsychology, where I focus on diagnosing cognitive, learning, and emotional difficulties. My primary goal is to provide diagnostic clarity for children and young adults, helping them gain a deeper understanding of themselves and their potential.

## Research Interests

As a researcher, I operate at the confluence of neuropsychology and genetics,
striving to comprehend how molecular genetics influence behavior and the risk
for psychiatric illness. My approach is grounded in the utilization of
open-source data science tools, allowing my colleagues and I to delve into the complex
interactions between genetics and neuropsychology.

- **Molecular Genetics:** Exploring the genetic underpinnings of behavior and mental health.

- **Neuropsychology:** Delving into the cognitive aspects of mental health conditions.

- **Neurodevelopment:** Understanding how the brain develops and changes from childhood into adulthood.

- **Data Science:** Utilizing data-driven approaches to enrich our understanding of psychiatric conditions.

## Contact Me

My work offers a unique glimpse into the intersection of
neuropsychology and neuroscience, providing valuable insights into the complex
interactions of the human mind. If you would like to learn more about my work
