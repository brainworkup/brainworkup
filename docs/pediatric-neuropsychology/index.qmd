## Deep-Dive Into Child and Adolescent Neurocognitive Evaluation 

Welcome to our practice. Below we describe the comprehensive pediatric neuropsychological services that our clinic offers. With a specialization in ADHD in girls, Autism Spectrum Disorders, dyslexia, and a broad variety of neurodevelopmental evaluations, we cater to a wide range of needs. We will walk you through our child-centered, evidence-based approach that focuses on detailed assessments and personalized care, and our commitment to working in collaboration with families and educators to support each child's unique developmental journey. 

## Spotlight on ADHD in Girls 

A niche area of our expertise is in the assessment and diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in girls. This is an area that has, unfortunately, been underrepresented in research and clinical practice. Girls often display ADHD symptoms differently than boys, and hence, we provide specialized evaluations to identify ADHD, factoring in the unique ways it may manifest in female patients. 

In our clinic, we adopt a comprehensive assessment approach that includes behavioral observations, standardized testing, and close collaboration with schools and families. The goal is to achieve a holistic understanding of each girl's strengths and challenges, and to support them in unlocking their full potential.

## Understanding Autism Spectrum Disorders 

We provide diagnostic and intervention services for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Our team utilizes evidence-based methods to assess social communication, behavioral patterns, and sensory processing differences characteristic of ASD. We tailor each evaluation to the person, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of their individual profile and needs.

## Addressing Dyslexia and Learning Disorders 

Our services also encompass the assessment and support of children with dyslexia and related learning disorders. We conduct detailed evaluations to identify specific learning profiles and provide recommendations for educational accommodations and interventions. Our ultimate aim is to help children overcome their learning challenges and excel academically.

## Comprehensive Neurodevelopmental Evaluations 

We offer exhaustive neuropsychological evaluations for a range of neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorders. These evaluations are instrumental in understanding a child's cognitive, academic, and social-emotional functioning. We provide detailed reports and personalized recommendations to support children in their developmental journey.

## Our Unique Approach 

Our unique approach to evaluation is child-centered and family-focused. We realize that each child is different, and therefore we customize our assessments to meet their specific needs. Our team works collaboratively with families, educators, and other professionals to ensure a supportive and integrated approach to care.

## Our Unwavering Commitment to Excellence 

We are committed to staying up-to-date with the latest research and advancements in pediatric neuropsychology. Our dedication to providing the highest quality of care ensures that each child we serve receives the support and guidance they need to succeed.
