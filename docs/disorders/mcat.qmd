## Overview

Many children, teenagers, and adults struggle with a range of mental and
physical disabilities including ADHD, learning disabilities such as Dyslexia,
Dysgraphia, or Dyscalculia, mental health conditions such as depression,
anxiety, and PTSD, and neurocognitive conditions such as a head injury. These
conditions can occur together and cause difficulties at school and work, which
is why the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) provides individuals with
reasonable academic accommodations such as extended time on exams, start and
stop breaks, access to assistive devices, and private testing rooms. 

For students with disabilities, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
ensures the right to reasonable academic accommodations.

Accommodations can be provided for the following standardized tests:

- [ACT](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/registration/accommodations.html?hsa_acc=5799955628&hsa_cam=20819547777&hsa_grp=&hsa_ad=&hsa_src=x&hsa_tgt=&hsa_kw=&hsa_mt=&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1)

## Submission Timeline

In general, requests should be submitted at least 60 days before the test date.

## Available Accommodations

Accommodations vary by disability, but common ones include extended time, private testing rooms, and additional breaks.

## Comprehensive Evaluation Requirement

A comprehensive evaluation by a qualified professional is essential to support the request.
It should include: 

- Clinical interview 

- Behavioral observations 

- Neuropsychological/psychoeducational testing 

- Detailed report with individualized analysis and recommendations

## Consultation

An initial consultation is scheduled to gather relevant background information. This is a good time to ask specific questions and address concerns you may have. We can provide the highest quality of service by working collaboratively with you. If further testing is warranted, a testing appointment will be made at that time.

## Testing & Evaluation

The testing session may last from 2-8 hours, depending on the referral question, nature of the problem, and availability of previous testing results. Of course, you will be allowed to take breaks as needed.

## Feedback Session

Following the evaluation, a feedback session with you and your family may be conducted to discuss results and recommendations. With consent, other professionals involved in treatment may participate and/or receive information about the evaluation.

## Report

A comprehensive report will be provided to you and your family. The report will include background information, test results, diagnosis, and recommendations. The report can then be used to apply for testing accommodations.


## Conclusion

Testing accommodations aim to level the playing field for applicants with disabilities, ensuring fair assessment of abilities.
Comprehensive evaluations by licensed professionals are vital for substantiating accommodation requests.
