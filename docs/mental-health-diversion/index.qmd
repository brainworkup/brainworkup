## An Introduction to Mental Health Diversion Evaluations

In recent years, the intersection of mental health and the criminal justice system has become a focal point of discussion and legislation. In 2018, a significant stride was made when Governor Jerry Brown signed into law Senate Bill 215. This bill paved the way for a pre-trial diversion program specifically designed for defendants who are suffering from a mental disorder and stand accused of committing certain crimes. 

## Understanding the Impact of Senate Bill 215

The implications of Senate Bill 215 are far-reaching. It offers a potential lifeline for individuals whose mental disorders may have played a significant role in their alleged criminal activities. Instead of facing the traditional punitive measures, these individuals are given the opportunity to complete a treatment program. 

The benefits of this approach are two-fold. If the accused completes the treatment, not only will the criminal charges be dismissed, but their arrest record will also be sealed. This allows for a fresh start, free from the stigma of a criminal record.

## Our Approach to Mental Health Diversion Evaluations

As experts in mental health evaluations, we believe in a collaborative approach. We work closely with the client, their family, their mental health treatment providers, and their attorney to conduct a comprehensive mental health diversion evaluation. 

Our in-depth assessment is designed to answer the critical questions related to the mental health diversion criteria. This includes:

- Confirming if the defendant suffers from a mental disorder. It's important to note that Antisocial Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Pedophilic Disorder are excluded from this category.
- Determining if the mental disorder played a significant role in the defendant's involvement in the alleged crime.
- Evaluating whether the defendant's symptoms that may have motivated the criminal behavior would respond positively to mental health treatment.
- Establishing whether the defendant agrees to comply with the treatment as a condition of diversion.
- Assessing if the defendant, if treated in the community, will pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, as defined in PC 1170.18.

By providing these evaluations, we hope to contribute to a more understanding and compassionate approach to criminal justice, where mental health is given the consideration it deserves.
