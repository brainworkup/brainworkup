## Welcome :wave:

I am the founder and chief neuropsychologist at BrainWorkup Neuropsychology,
LLC, and an Assistant Professor at the [Keck School of Medicine of USC's
Department of Psychiatry and the Behavioral Sciences](https://keck.usc.edu/psychiatry/). My primary goal is to provide diagnostic clarity for children and adults, helping them gain a deeper understanding of themselves and their potential.

My two-decade career spans research and clinical practice, focusing on neuropsychology, psychiatric genetics, and data science. As a clinical pediatric neuropsychologist, I've spent over a decade diagnosing cognitive and emotional difficulties in children and young adults, while my research investigates the genetic underpinnings of behavior and mental health.

My work is published in numerous high-impact journals, and I am involved in multiple federally-funded research projects with colleagues at USC and CHLA. I'm a member of the American Psychological Association, the International Neuropsychological Society, and the Society for Biological Psychiatry, and a licensed psychologist in California and New York.

## Research Interests

As a researcher, I operate at the confluence of neuropsychology and genetics, striving to comprehend how molecular genetics influence behavior and the risk for psychiatric illness.
My approach is grounded in the utilization of open-source data science tools, allowing my colleagues and I to delve into the complex interactions between genetics and neuropsychology.

-   **Molecular Genetics:** Exploring the genetic underpinnings of behavior and mental health.

-   **Neuropsychology:** Delving into the cognitive aspects of mental health conditions.

-   **Neurodevelopment:** Understanding how the brain develops and changes from childhood into adulthood.

-   **Data Science:** Utilizing data-driven approaches to enrich our understanding of psychiatric conditions.
