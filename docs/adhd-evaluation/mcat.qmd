## Overview

The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) is essential for medical school applicants in the U.S. and Canada.
It evaluates problem-solving, critical thinking, and science knowledge.
For students with disabilities, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) ensures the right to reasonable academic accommodations.

## ADA and MCAT Accommodations

Under the ADA, individuals with a disability (physical or mental) that substantially limits major life activities are entitled to reasonable academic accommodations.
These modifications ensure equal opportunities and true potential performance.

## Covered Disabilities

The ADA recognizes a range of disabilities for MCAT accommodations: - Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) - Dyslexia - Psychological Conditions (e.g., Depression, Anxiety) - Physical Disabilities - Sensory impairments (vision/hearing) - Physical impairments (e.g., Crohnâ€™s disease) - Acquired head injuries
