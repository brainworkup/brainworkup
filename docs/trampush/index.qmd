## Specialization and Expertise

As a clinician, Dr. Trampush's expertise lies in developmental neuropsychology, where he focuses on diagnosing cognitive, learning, and emotional difficulties. His primary goal is to provide diagnostic clarity for children and young adults, helping them gain a deeper understanding of themselves and their potential.

## Research Interests

As a researcher, Dr. Trampush operates at the confluence of neuropsychology and genetics, striving to comprehend how molecular genetics influence behavior and the risk for psychiatric illness. His approach is grounded in the utilization of open-source data science tools, allowing him to delve into the complex interactions between genetics and neuropsychology.

- **Molecular Genetics:** Exploring the genetic underpinnings of behavior and mental health.

- **Neuropsychology:** Delving into the cognitive aspects of mental health conditions.

- **Neurodevelopment:** Understanding how the brain develops and changes from childhood into adulthood.

- **Data Science:** Utilizing data-driven approaches to enrich our understanding of psychiatric conditions.
