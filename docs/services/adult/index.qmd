## ADHD in College Students

We provide comprehensive ADHD evaluations for college students. We can also provide documentation for accommodations at your university.

## Psychoeducational Testing

We can provide comprehensive psychoeducational evaluations for college students
relevant to MCAT, LSAT, GRE, and other standardized tests.

## Consultation

An initial consultation is scheduled to gather relevant background information. This is a good time to ask specific questions and address concerns you may have. We can provide the highest quality of service by working collaboratively with you. If further testing is warranted, a testing appointment will be made at that time.

## Testing & Evaluation

The testing session may last from 2-8 hours, depending on the referral question, nature of the problem, and availability of previous testing results. Of course, you will be allowed to take breaks as needed.

## Feedback Session

Following the evaluation, a feedback session with you and your family may be conducted to discuss results and recommendations. With consent, other professionals involved in treatment may participate and/or receive information about the evaluation.

## Report

A comprehensive report will be provided to you and your family. The report will include background information, test results, diagnosis, and recommendations. The report can then be used to apply for testing accommodations.
