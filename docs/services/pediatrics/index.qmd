## Practice Focus

### ADHD in Girls

At our clinic, we specialize in the assessment and diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in girls, an area that has historically been underrepresented in research and clinical practice. Recognizing that girls often exhibit ADHD symptoms differently than boys, we offer specialized evaluations to identify ADHD, taking into account the unique ways it may present in female patients.

Our comprehensive assessment approach includes behavioral observations, standardized testing, and close collaboration with schools and families. We aim to provide a holistic understanding of each girl's strengths and challenges, supporting them in achieving their full potential.

### Autism Spectrum Disorders

We provide diagnostic and intervention services for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Our team employs evidence-based methods to evaluate social communication, behavioral patterns, and sensory processing differences characteristic of ASD. Our evaluations are tailored to each child, ensuring a thorough understanding of their individual profile and needs.

### Dyslexia and Learning Disorders

Our services extend to the evaluation and support of children with dyslexia and related learning disorders. Through detailed assessments, we identify specific learning profiles and provide recommendations for educational accommodations and interventions. Our goal is to help children overcome their learning challenges and thrive academically.

### Comprehensive Neurodevelopmental Evaluations

We offer comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations for a range of neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorders. These evaluations are crucial in understanding a child's cognitive, academic, and social-emotional functioning. We provide detailed reports and personalized recommendations to support children in their developmental journey.

### Our Approach

Our evaluations are child-centered and family-focused. We understand that each child is unique, and we tailor our assessments to meet their specific needs. Our team works collaboratively with families, educators, and other professionals to ensure a supportive and integrated approach to care.

### Commitment to Excellence
