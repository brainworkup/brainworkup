We specialize in conducting psychological and neuropsychological evaluations for insurance companies and attorneys in worker’s compensation and personal injury cases.

A comprehensive psychological or neuropsychological evaluation will help identify how an injury or traumatic event impacted your client and help them with compensation and treatment.

## How We Can Help
A comprehensive evaluation is essential if your client is experiencing psychological or neuropsychological impairment due to an injury or exposure to a traumatic event. We specialize in writing medical-legal reports to address the unique needs of our clients that are seeking impartial disability evaluations.

The opinions we provide are done with a reasonable degree of medical certainty and supported by the use of evidence-based and empirically supported psychological and neuropsychological tests. We will help identify how an event impacted your client and provide treatment recommendations to help improve your client’s quality of life.

## Complaints and Conditions That May Indicate Need for Testing
- Emotional Distress
- Employer Discrimination or Harassment
- Exposure to a Traumatic Event

## What to Expect
Our personal injury and independent medical evaluations typically involve:

A detailed clinical interview with your client and collateral sources to determine their pre and post-injury functioning. These interviews will help us understand important psychological, medical, and social background information, and their current cognitive and psychological functioning.
Consultation with the attorney or insurance company to determine the medical-legal questions that need to be answered.
A review of medical, psychological, and other collateral documents that help us have a better understanding of your client’s psychological and emotional functioning pre and post-injury.
We will administer neuropsychological and psychological tests to objectively assess for mental health diagnoses or cognitive impairment.

We will administer and interpret paper and computer-based tests to assess for:
- General intellectual abilities
- Higher level executive skills such as reasoning and problem solving
- Attention and concentration
- Language comprehension and communication
- Visual-spatial skills and perception
- Memory impairment
- Motor and sensory skills
- Mood and personality
- Psychological diagnoses

After we complete the evaluation, we will write a comprehensive report that integrates our findings, reviews the course of the injury, discusses your client’s prognosis, and provide treatment recommendations.
